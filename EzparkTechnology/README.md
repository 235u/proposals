# Ezpark Technology

The Airbnb Of Parking, according to [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ezparkapp.ezpark) and [Apple App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ezpark-shared-parking/id1449009586?ls=1) store apps; see [job details](docs/_static/job-details.pdf) (ongoing project, hourly), as posted on October 28, 2019.

## Quotation

**Accomplished work**, in hours, **by**   
**hourly rate** between **$32.00** and **$64.00**, up for negotiation, depending on your budget / total amount of hours you are willing to pay for to achieve your goals, **results in**   
**total price**.

E.g. Minimal hours amount of 256, as an assumption, results in a minimal price of 256 by hourly rate.

###	Timeline

Project start date / date of hire / date of proposal submission / **08/01/2020 – open end**.

E.g. 32 hours per week up to 256 hours results in a project start date plus 8 weeks timeline.

## Work Structure

**20%** of work, to reach the functional requirements / desired quantity, implementing the happy case, following the happy path, working under ideal / narrow set of conditions, with manual help from the developer; **80%** of rework, to reach the non-functional requirements / desired quality, in an iterative manner, visualized as a spiral; 

**20%** of writing in natural language / English and multiple artificial / technical languages; **80%** of rewriting, to reach higher quality;

**40%** of problem definition; **60%** of problem resolution, whereby the final solution represents its finely detailed problem definition (formulated in natural and artificial languages), being whether right or wrong / true or false, but good or bad / better or worse in reference to the initial state at project start, and having no formal stopping rule / never being perfectly complete (though having natural constraints in form of finite resources for its resolution / time / skill / budget / motivation / state of the market etc.);

**80%** of thinking, analysis / decomposition, synthesis / composition, (logical) induction, deduction / inference; **20%** of acting / adaptive, well thought out, reacting, as analogies.

###	Breakdown

Representing rough approximations, being flexible / adaptive.

#### Core Processes

Primary, resultative task sequences, adding value to / forming the substance of / targeting the final product / service:

- **10%** planning / requirements analysis and documentation / learning domain specifics / estimation; 
- **10%** system and process analysis, structural and object-oriented / process modelling;
- **20%** architecture / design / evaluation of third-party components and services / prototyping;
- **20%** construction / programming;
- **30%** validation / verification / low-level- and high-level-testing / white-box- and black-box-testing / unit-, integration-, system-, load- and acceptance-testing / debugging.

#### Supportive Processes

Organizational, cooperative tasks, running in parallel, targeting all parties involved, including suppliers of third-party products and services, supporting the core processes by:

- **10%** configuration management / infrastructure configuration / versioning and release-management;
- **20%** project / requirements management / spoken and written communication / mitigation and negotiation / documentation;
- **70%** quality assurance / static and dynamic analysis / build- and run-time measurements.
