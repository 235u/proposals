- Implement operations support systems like monitoring, reporting, etc.

### Problem Decomposition

- Break up problems into multiple functions
- Come up with reusable functions / objects that solve the overall problem
- Write generic / object-oriented code, that encapsulate aspects of the problem that are subject to change, using appropriate data structures and algorithms

## Modus operandi

Follows Kent Beck's four rules of Simple Design (in Martin Fowler's [interpretation](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BeckDesignRules.html)), in order of importance:

1.	Passes the tests (including non-automated / manually executed tests)
2.	Reveals intention (purpose is easy to understand)
3.	Contains no duplication (everything should be said "once and only once")<sup>[<a href="https://github.com/nikita-sharov/docs.de-de">1</a>, <a href="">2</a>]</sup>
4.	Minimizes the number of elements (anything that doesn't serve the three prior rules should be removed)

### Requirements

- Comes up with questions regarding missed cases / areas that need to be speced<sup>[<a href="https://github.com/235u/proposals/tree/master/GamePriceComparison">1</a>]</sup>
- Suggests better alternatives / flows to given requirements based on experience, feedback, tests, and measurements<sup>[<a href="https://github.com/235u/proposals/tree/master/OutlookSynchronisation">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/235u/proposals/tree/master/ThrottledScraper">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/235u/proposals/tree/master/SpeechToText">3</a>]</sup>

- Is proficient in using centralized (CVS / SVN / TFS) and distributed version control systems (Git / Mercurial)
- Knows how to branch and merge, setup repository properties, etc.

### Defensive coding

- Asserts critical assumptions in code
- Checks externally set arguments
- Makes sure to check return values and check for exceptions around code that can fail
- Comes up with good unit test cases for the code that is being written
- Writes unit tests that simulate faults

### Error handling	

- Comes up with guidelines on exception handling for the entire system
- Maintains consistent exception handling strategy in all layers of code
- Codes to detect possible exceptions before
- Ensures that errors / exceptions leave the program in a well-defined state (resources, connections, and memory is all cleaned up properly)

## Delivery

### Source tree organization

Relates to the entire set of artifacts that define the system:

- No circular dependencies; binaries, libs, docs, builds, third-party code are all organized into appropriate folders.
- Physical layout of the source tree matches logical hierarchy and organization; directory naming and organization provide insights into the design of the whole system.

### Code organization across files

- Related source files are grouped into folders.
- Each physical file has a unique purpose (for e.g. one class definition, one feature implementation, etc.).
- Code organization at the physical level closely matches the design, and looking at file names and folder distribution provides insights into design.

### Code organization within a file

- Methods are grouped logically and / or by accessibility.
- Code is grouped into regions and well commented with references to other source files.
- Consistent white space usage; files look beautiful.

### Code readability

- Good names for files, folders, variables, classes, methods, etc.
- Comments explaining unusual code, bug fixes, and code assumptions
- No long functions, no deep nesting of conditionals; code flows naturally.

## Knowledge

- Has heard of upcoming technologies in the field
- Knows about alternatives to popular and standard tools

### Data structures 

- Understands basic database concepts, normalization, indices, transactions
- Can do basic database administration, performance / index / query optimization, write advanced select queries
- Understands how databases can be mirrored, replicated, etc.
- Knows basic sorting, searching, and data structure traversal and retrieval algorithms
- Is proficient in the use of the ORM tools
- Considers space and time tradeoffs of arrays, linked lists, dictionaries, priority queues, etc.
- Knows how hashtables can be implemented and how to handle collisions

### Systems programming

- Understands the entire programming stack (compilers, linkers, and interpreters; just-in-time compilation; static and dynamic linking; binary and assembly code; garbage collection, heap, stack, memory addressing; static / dynamic, weak / strong typing, type inference, lazy evaluation)
- Vaguely remembers what assembly code is and how things work at the hardware level (CPU / memory / cache / interrupts / microcode)
- Knows about virtual memory and paging; kernel / user mode, multi-threading, and synchronization primitives
- Understands how networks work, understanding of network protocols and socket level programming
