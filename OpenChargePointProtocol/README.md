# Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) Full Stack Development for EV Charging Equipment

See [job details](docs/job-details.pdf) (ongoing project, fixed-price), as posted on March 1, 2020, within `Full Stack Development`, asking for expertise in `ASP.NET` and `Bootstrap`.

> Deliverables will be a full stack front end, back end, android and ios application for running and operating electrical equipment that is Open Chargepoint Point Protocol (OCPP).

Electrical equipment means (physical) charge points (stations) for electric vehicles, right? Running on `Android` and / or `iOS` itself, as devices, or to be operated via mobile devices running on `Android` / `iOS`?

According to the [Open Charge Alliance](https://www.openchargealliance.org/protocols):

> The goal for Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) is to offer a uniform solution for the method of communication between charge point and central system. With this protocol it is possible to connect any central system with any charge point, regardless of the vendor. A uniform standard prevents all kinds of coordination problems and  is therefore an advantage for the whole electric vehicle market.

Which side(s) do you represent (being an EV charging station vendor, and / or a central management system vendor, and / or a charge point operator, or something else)?

Which OCCP version(s) ([1.5](https://www.openchargealliance.org/protocols/ocpp-15/) / [1.6](https://www.openchargealliance.org/protocols/ocpp-16/) / [2.0](https://www.openchargealliance.org/protocols/ocpp-20/) / [2.0.1 RC](https://www.openchargealliance.org/protocols/ocpp-201/)) and which flavors / message formats (`XML/SOAP` / `JSON`) do you want to support?

> We are looking for someone able to do the job in record time, a rock star, so if you think you are the one, we are ready to agree a much better deal for you.

What does "record time" mean to you (as a period of time, and as an amount of work in hours)? Can you afford a "rock star"? What does "a much better deal" mean in numbers?

Do you have access to the [OCPP Compliance Testing Tool](https://www.openchargealliance.org/protocols/test-tool/info/)?

> OCPP Compliance Testing Tool is a tool to assist OCA members to test the systems implementing the OCPP version for the conformance to the guidelines specified in the OCPP specification. The tool can test the compliancy of both charge point and Central System.

This tool being (marketed as) the reference implementation for all OCCP versions, flavors, being able to simulate all the specified use cases (according my understanding), and being priced between 6.000 and 16.000 euros.

## Deliverables

- `API` and `API Integration`: Which (third party?) API(s) do you want to integrate?
- `Custom PHP`: While asking for `ASP.NET` at the same time?
- `Database Architecture`: Which database engine(s) would you like to use?
- `Desktop Applications`: You are also asking for multiple desktop applications?
- `e-Commerce Website`: Like a webshop? What are you going to sell (hardware / software / services)? 
- `Web Application`, `Web Design`, and `Website Development` (I doubt the latter to be deliverable): The `Web Application` and the `Website` (to be developed) are not the same (being two different web applications)?
