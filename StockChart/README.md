# Add some features to a wpf application (c#/Telerik)

See [job details](docs/job-details.pdf) (one-time project, fixed-price), as posted on March 3, 2020, within `Desktop Software Development`, asking for expertise in `C#`.

> Preferred qualifications, location: Bulgaria, Croatia, Ukraine, Romania, Russia, Poland, Bosnia and Herzegovina

I'm from Russia, living in Austria (UTC+01:00).

> detailed step-by-step instructions for tweaks that need to be done will be provided

I do expect these instructions to be provided before being hired (if you decide to).

> If you are an experienced C# developer with good work ethic, eye for detail and sound coding practices please apply.

See https://github.com/235u for my coding practices, https://www.235u.net for visual details, and https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics I'm trying to adhere to.

Do you have a website? Does your code base follow "sound coding practices"?

> We [...] will offer bonus over our agreed amount and additional work for job well done.

I do expect detailed instructions on "additional work" before being hired. I'm not asking you for bonuses, but for a fair remuneration "for high quality work done right".

> Core skills needed for the project: Telerik UI for WPF/Radchartview

I have worked with "Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC" for 2 years (2016 - 2018, using various controls, including charts). Please note that I don't have a Telerik subscription myself now, you'll have to provide the libraries required by the https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/wpf/controls/radchartview/overview (in the most actual version, I hope).

## Asked questions

### This project pays (agreed amount + bonus) only after fully tested code is delivered. No milestone or escrow payments will be made (a minimum escrow payment required by upwork will be done when we begin). Is this understood and ok?

Ehm, it's not OK, I suppose (also depending on other answers, your response times, infrastructure, and code base quality), if you are asking me to agree on a $10 project (fixed-price, to be paid at the end, by project; covered by the Upwork fixed-price protection), promising more ("agreed amount + bonus") at the end. Please correct me If I am wrong.

"Fully tested code" tested by you? (Automated "front-end" testing, and charts especially, is not that "simple/straightforward".)

How do you expect the code to be delivered (version control)? 

### Are you the developer who will be working on this project if selected (no subcontracting)?

Yes, no subcontracting. Who do you represent? Are you the primary developer of the application in question (no subcontracting)?

>  You will add/modify some features on top of this application. The project itself is fairly simple/straightforward and detailed step-by-step instructions for tweaks that need to be done will be provided.

Why don't you do it yourself, being that "simple/straightforward" and having "detailed step-by-step instructions"?

### Is it understood that this project is not available to work on hourly basis?

Yes. Because of this question I have to ask you: Why is this project not available to work on an hourly basis?

Hypothetically speaking, your budget is limited to $500, how many hours of "expert level" work do you expect to get for this money (as a rough estimate), being "willing to pay higher rates for the most experienced freelancers"?

### How many months/years of experience you have with C#?

10+ years.

### If selected when can you start and how many hours/week can you spend on this project?

I could start the next day after being hired, and I could spend between 20 highly-concentrated and 60 less-highly-concentrated hours a week on this project.

How many hours of "high quality work" would it take you / your team to get this job "done right" (as a rough estimate)?
