- pulls data every minute
- relies on data provided by Valve and, well, sometimes Valve Web API servers do not work as intended
- is still in beta, so expect major bugs.

> **"Owned" means "Sold", right?**

> No. "Owned" means "owned". It includes games bought on Steam, bought in retail and then activated on Steam, bought in bundles, recieved through promotions or as a gift and so on. It also includes copies temporarily given away on "free weekends", so take care when coming to conclusions about sales or revenue.

> And don't forget about games without Steamworks support sold on Origin, Uplay or GOG. They're not taken into account by Steam Spy.

> I wrote a proposal to Valve that would still let Steam Spy run using the old algorithm without exposing any personal data. I’ve got a confirmation from Tom Giardino that they’ve received my message, but that was it.

## Ars Technica

The core of our data comes from the individual profile pages on Valve’s SteamCommunity.com social portal, such as this one for yours truly. Prominent on each of these public pages, again just a click away, is a list of every game that Steam users have registered to their accounts. This page also lists how many hours they’ve played for each of those titles.

Those with deep pockets can pay for access to a treasure trove of historic and current sales numbers, but subscribers are contractually forbidden from sharing those numbers with the public.

The information we’ve collected over the past few months includes not only sales estimates for every game on Steam, but also data on how many hours Steam users have spent time playing those games. The result is a wide-ranging survey of a service that estimates suggest represents 70 to 75 percent of the current PC gaming market in the US.

The "owned but unplayed" phenomenon is an extremely widespread issue across Steam according to our data. It shows up most frequently in games included in bundles, offered at heavily reduced prices, or simply given away to players who have yet to actually play them.

Before you protest that this number sounds incredibly high, consider how many Steam games you’ve acquired through some sort of indie game bundle or ridiculous seasonal sale. You probably heard some good buzz about these titles and told yourself you’d find the time to play them some day in the future. Then you went right back to playing *Team Fortress 2* for dozens of hours every week instead, didn't you?

It's important to note that the precise ratio of played-to-unplayed copies varies greatly for each distinct game sold on Steam, as shown in the chart above. Some games (mostly free-to-play titles) show practically 100 percent of all "owners" putting in at least a little bit of playtime. Others, primarily those that are often offered in bundles or as part of sales, are played by only a sliver of the registered owners on the service.
