> 2. **Copyright Owner Sends A Notice.** After conducting an investigation, a copyright owner prepares and sends a [takedown notice](https://help.github.com/en/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice) to GitHub. Assuming the takedown notice is sufficiently detailed according to the statutory requirements (as explained in the [how-to guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice)), we will [post the notice](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/dmca-takedown-policy#d-transparency) to our [public repository](https://github.com/github/dmca) and pass the link along to the affected user.

several mails later, prepending step 3 before step 2 (why not?),

> 3. **GitHub Asks User to Make Changes.** If the notice alleges that the entire contents of a repository infringe, we will skip to Step 6 and disable the entire repository expeditiously. Otherwise, because GitHub cannot disable access to specific files within a repository, we will contact the user who created the repository and give them approximately 24 hours to delete or modify the content specified in the notice. We'll notify the copyright owner if and when we give the user a chance to make changes.
