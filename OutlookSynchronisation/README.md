### 2. Do you have suggestions to make this project run successfully?

releasing often and early.

### 3. What past project or job have you had that is most like this one and why?

I've maintained / extended multiple add-ins for: 

- newsletter composition in Microsoft Outlook, as VSTO add-in, written in C#, 2-3 years ago, 
- machinery engineering (component classification / standardisation / management), in Microsoft Word, and Excel (as VSTO add-ins), Autodesk AutoCAD and Inventor, with similar infrastructure (targeting .NET), about 5 years ago.

### 4. What questions do you have about the project?

The job is posted under `Desktop Software Development`, usually being platform dependent (e.g. targeting, the specification refers i.a. to [Outlook add-ins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/add-ins/) (more exactly speaking: [the quick start tutorial for Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/add-ins/quick-start?tabs=visualstudio)), being web applications in general:

> Outlook add-ins are different from COM or VSTO add-ins, which are older integrations specific to Outlook running on Windows. Unlike COM add-ins, Outlook add-ins don't have any code physically installed on the user's device or Outlook client. For an Outlook add-in, Outlook reads the manifest and hooks up the specified controls in the UI, and then loads the JavaScript and HTML. The web components all run in the context of a browser in a sandbox.

The Setup ()

What does this

> I am willing to pay higher rates for the most experienced freelancers

mean to you in numbers? Furthermore I would be interested in:

- the upper budget boundary, recompensation model for additional features (on scope and feature creep, if any, according expediture); 
- the overall time-schedule / release plan / milestones;
- products and services you are more comfortable with (GitHub, Slack, Discord, Trello, Jira etc.);
- technology stack of your CRM;
- non-functional requirements (performance constraints, number of users, contacts / calendar events to sync on average); 
- quality assurance assistance, sample data / account for testing purposes; 
- further maintenance in production.
